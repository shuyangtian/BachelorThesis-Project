# Bachelor Thesis – Quantifying Information Loss Resulting from Degradation of IMU Sensor Resolution in PD Symptom Classification

This repository contains the code and analysis scripts from my Bachelor's Thesis at [Your University].  
The work investigates how reducing the resolution of IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) sensors impacts the performance of machine learning models in classifying Parkinson’s Disease (PD) symptoms.

## 🎯 Overview
- Simulated degradation of IMU sensor resolution in recorded motion datasets  
- Extracted kinematic features related to PD symptoms (e.g., tremor, bradykinesia)  
- Trained and evaluated machine learning models for PD symptom classification  
- Quantified information loss using statistical metrics and model performance measures

## 🛠️ Technologies
- **Python** (NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib)  
- **Signal Processing** (time-series feature extraction, IMU data analysis)  
- **Machine Learning** (classification models, evaluation metrics)  
- **Data Visualization** (plots, performance graphs)

## 📊 Results
- Demonstrated measurable accuracy drop when IMU resolution decreases  
- Identified critical thresholds where classification performance degrades significantly  
- Provided design insights for wearable, IMU-based PD monitoring systems
