# LaTeX thesis git

## Basics
- Before downloading / cloning this git or even worse - directly starting with your TeX-_code_,
please take a step back and have a look at the __guidelines within the templates__!

- Note that you will not be able to push this git directly. You will have to create you own repository in your private LSR-git.

- If you do not have LaTeX installed yet, please check the [installation-page](https://wiki.tum.de/display/lsritr/An+introduction+to+LaTeX#installation).

- In case you do not/ cannot install LaTex, [TUM's version of Sharelatex](https://sharelatex.tum.de) is an alternative for you, but __ASK YOUR SUPERVISOR FIRST, IF HE IS FINE WITH THAT!!__
