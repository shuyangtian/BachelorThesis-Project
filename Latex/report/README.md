# Using this template

## Default thesis

1. Open ``StudentThesis_Template.tex`` 
2. Select option to you needs
 
 - LSR vs ITR
 - BA, MA, etc 
 - english vs german
 - intermediate if needed
 
 these options are to be added on first line in the ``documentclass`` definition

3. adjust the personal data and thesis information
4. check through the tutorial that shows basic use of the provided template. Nonethless, please remove the ```tutorial`` flag for the final (and intermediate) delivery version from the documentclass line


## Paper template

for FPs you have the option to use the official IEEE transaction latex style document.
Thus the options from above are redundant and you can proceed with the ``FP_paper.tex`` file instead.



In case there are open issues / problems and misunderstandings, please file an issue in this repository.
