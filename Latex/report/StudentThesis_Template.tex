\begin{abstract}
  Abnormal movements are often characteristic of Parkinson's disease (PD), and to monitor these movements, IMU sensors can be used to measure the movement signal. Due to the high cost of high-resolution sensors, we will investigate the feasibility of using low-cost sensors, i.e., low resolution. This work will quantify the loss of information to the activity dataset due to the reduced resolution of the IMU sensors. After acquiring the IMU dataset at the original sampling rate, it will be resampled using a different sampling rate to simulate the dataset later collected by the low-resolution IMU sensor. We will then extrapolate the minimum requirements for the IMU sensor within a certain threshold. For this work, we first classify the inertial measurement unit (IMU) data and ratings of Parkinson's symptoms by the k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm. Then, by calculating the information loss between different sampling frequencies, we can observe the change in information loss that accompanies the decrease in sampling frequency to derive a threshold value.
